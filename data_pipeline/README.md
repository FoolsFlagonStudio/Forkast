# Forkast Data Pipeline

Python scripts that build Forkast's ingredient catalog from USDA FoodData Central, scrape recipe pages with [`recipe-scrapers`](https://github.com/hhursev/recipe-scrapers), and set up prices (Kroger product mapping, BLS average prices, seed prices), then send everything to the backend's admin API.

> **Status:** working. The catalog has 153 ingredients, the first scrape imported 17 recipes from 2 sites, and 152 ingredients are mapped to Kroger products.

## Responsibilities

The scripts only **fetch and forward**. They never parse ingredient lines, match ingredients, compute nutrition or unit prices, or assign dietary labels; the backend owns all of that (see [../backend/README.md](../backend/README.md#recipe-ingestion)).

Keeping the scripts thin means parsing rules live in one place, and the backend can re-process saved recipes after a fix without re-scraping.

## Ingredient catalog

```bash
python find_fdc.py            # fill blank fdc_ids, then review the matches
python fdc_lookup.py 174036   # check a hand-picked id
python seed_ingredients.py --dry-run
python seed_ingredients.py    # 0 created / N updated on a re-run
```

**Picking FDC foods.** `find_fdc.py` searches SR Legacy first, because its household portions ("1 large", "1 cup, chopped", "1 clove") are what recipe conversion needs; Foundation is the fallback. FDC search ranking is unreliable, so read every `fdc_description`. Watch for restaurant brands, cooked versions, branded items, and the wrong animal ("ground beef" matched ground turkey). Fix a row by pasting an id from `cache/fdc_candidates.csv`, or by clearing `fdc_id`, editing `query`, and re-running. A word starting with `-` in a query excludes that word, and `/` makes FDC return 400.

**Checks before any API call.** Names must be lowercase and unique, aliases can't repeat across rows, tags must be valid, and two rows can't share an `fdc_id` (the backend updates by it).

**Extraction** (`seed_ingredients.py`):

| Value               | From                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Portions            | `foodPortions`: Foundation keeps the unit in `measureUnit.name`; SR Legacy sets it to "undetermined" and puts it in `modifier`. Stored as the weight of ONE unit (0.5 cup = 44 g becomes cup = 88 g). RACC and NLEA servings are skipped. |

All values are per 100 g. Negative values (carbs "by difference" can come out slightly below zero) are clamped to 0.

**Tags** drive dietary labels: MEAT, POULTRY, FISH, SHELLFISH, DAIRY, EGG, GLUTEN, TREE_NUT, PEANUT, SOY, HONEY, GELATIN. Broths carry POULTRY or MEAT; Worcestershire carries FISH (anchovies).

## Scraping recipes

```bash
python scrape_recipes.py --dry-run   # fetch and cache, print one payload, post nothing
python scrape_recipes.py             # post (reads the cache, so the sites aren't hit again)
```

### Rules the script follows

- Checks each site's `robots.txt` and skips disallowed paths. A missing robots.txt allows everything; 401/403 or an unreachable one means the site is skipped.
- One request at a time, 3 to 5 seconds apart per site, or the site's `Crawl-delay` if longer.
- Identifies itself with `ForkastRecipeBot/0.1 (personal project; contact <email>)`.
- Caches every page in `cache/html/`, so re-runs never download a page twice.
- Never works around logins, paywalls or bot protection. Damn Delicious returns 403 to automated requests, so it is not used.
- Read a site's terms of use before adding it to `urls.txt`.

**Sites in use:** sipandfeast.com and budgetbytes.com (both supported by `recipe-scrapers`). Unsupported sites fall back to schema.org data (`supported_only=False`).

### Copyright

Ingredient lists are facts and generally not protected; instructions, descriptions and photos usually are. Storing them for local development and a portfolio demo is fine. Before a public release, choose one: show ingredients, nutrition and cost with a link to the source for instructions; use a licensed recipe API; use recipes you have rights to; or ask sources for permission. Keep `source_url` and show attribution either way. This is not legal advice.

## Prices

The backend owns all pricing math (see [../backend/README.md](../backend/README.md#pricing)). These scripts choose products and send raw prices.

### BLS average prices

```bash
python import_prices.py bls --dry-run   # fetch and print, post nothing
python import_prices.py bls             # post; already-stored months are skipped
```

Each price is dated at the end of its month, so the backend's 60-day window keeps the newest month current until the next is published (about two weeks after a month ends). BLS stopped publishing many series (onions, carrots, celery, peppers, broccoli, mushrooms, apples...); those were removed from `bls_series.csv` and Kroger covers them. The raw response is cached in `cache/bls/`.

### Kroger product mapping

```bash
python find_product.py                     # search for every ingredient without a row
python find_product.py --only "lime" --query "fresh limes"   # redo one with other words
python find_product.py --post              # send kroger_products.csv to the backend
curl -X POST -H "X-Admin-Key: $KEY" http://localhost:8080/api/admin/prices/refresh
```

`find_product.py` searches the configured store and keeps the best guess: has a price, most words of the ingredient name, Kroger's store brand, not organic unless asked, not a drink or snack. The top 5 per ingredient go to `cache/kroger_candidates.csv`. Searches are cached in `cache/kroger/search/` (`--only` always searches again).

**Review before posting.** Search ranking is a first guess:

- "lemon" and "lime" return lemon-lime soda first; "cashews" returned cashew milk.
- Prefer products with a weight in the size ("16 oz", "3 lb") or sold by weight. "1 each" or "1 ct" items get a price per 100 g only when Kroger gives the package weight; otherwise only a price per item, and cup or teaspoon lines stay unpriced.
- Fresh herbs at this store come in 0.5 oz packages, which makes herb-heavy recipes expensive. Look for larger packages or use dried.
- Watch for premium brands and case listings ("24 ct / 14.5 oz" priced per can).

Fix a pick by pasting a `product_id` from the candidates, add a second row as a backup (the cheaper one per 100 g wins), or set `active` to `false`. When `--only` finds a new match it keeps the old row with `active=false`, so `--post` switches it off in the backend and its old prices stop counting; delete those rows after posting. A search that finds nothing leaves the existing row alone.

### Seed prices

For ingredients neither Kroger nor BLS covers. Add rows to `prices_seed.csv` (`ingredient,price,size,note`, size like a store label: `1 lb`, `16 oz`, `1 dozen`), then `python import_prices.py seed`. Editing a price and re-running adds a new row; unchanged rows are skipped.

### Checking prices

```sql
-- Latest price per active Kroger product, highest per 100 g first (spices at the top are normal)
with latest as (
  select distinct on (p.ingredient_id, p.external_id)
         i.name, p.price_per_100g, p.price_per_item, p.size_text, p.price
  from ingredient_prices p
  join ingredients i on i.id = p.ingredient_id
  join ingredient_products m on m.ingredient_id = p.ingredient_id
       and m.external_id = p.external_id and m.source = 'KROGER' and m.active
  where p.source = 'KROGER'
  order by p.ingredient_id, p.external_id, p.recorded_at desc
)
select * from latest order by price_per_100g desc nulls last;

-- Recipe costs
select name, cost_per_serving, cost_complete from recipes order by cost_per_serving nulls last;
```

## Backend contract

All routes require the `X-Admin-Key` header.

### `POST /api/admin/ingredients/import` (up to 50)

```json
{
  "ingredients": [
    {
      "fdcId": 171077,
      "name": "chicken breast",
      "aliases": ["chicken breasts"],
      "tags": ["POULTRY"],
      "caloriesPer100g": 120.0,
      "proteinGPer100g": 22.5,
      "carbsGPer100g": 0.0,
      "fatGPer100g": 2.62,
      "portions": [{ "description": "piece", "gramWeight": 272.0 }]
    }
  ]
}
```

Response: `{ "created": 50, "updated": 0 }`. Matching on `fdcId` makes re-runs safe.

### `POST /api/admin/recipes/ingest` (up to 25)

```json
{
  "recipes": [
    {
      "sourceUrl": "https://www.sipandfeast.com/chicken-riggies/",
      "host": "sipandfeast.com",
      "name": "Chicken Riggies",
      "description": "...",
      "prepTimeMinutes": 5,
      "cookTimeMinutes": 40,
      "yields": "6 servings",
      "rawIngredients": [
        "1 pound (454g) rigatoni",
        "8 cloves garlic (chopped)"
      ],
      "rawInstructions": ["Bring a large pot of salted water to boil.", "..."],
      "imageUrl": "https://...",
      "category": "Main Course",
      "cuisine": "Italian",
      "keywords": ["chicken riggies"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Response: `{ "created": 17, "skippedDuplicate": 0, "failed": [{ "sourceUrl": "...", "reason": "..." }], "needsReview": 41 }`. A bad recipe is listed in `failed` without affecting the rest. `yields` is sent raw and parsed by the backend; missing fields are sent as `null`. Nutrition is never sent: the backend computes it.

### `POST /api/admin/prices/import` (up to 200)

```json
{
  "prices": [
    {
      "ingredient": "chicken breast",
      "source": "BLS",
      "price": 4.17,
      "size": "1 lb",
      "externalId": "APU0000FF1101",
      "recordedAt": "2026-09-01T00:00:00Z",
      "storeName": "BLS U.S. city average"
    }
  ]
}
```

`ingredient` is a catalog name or alias. `source` is `BLS`, `SEED`, `MANUAL` or `OPEN_PRICES` (Kroger prices only come from the refresh). `recordedAt` defaults to now. Response: `{ "imported": 23, "skipped": 0, "failed": [{ "ingredient": "...", "reason": "..." }], "recipesRecosted": 19 }`.

### `POST /api/admin/prices/products` (up to 500)

```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "ingredient": "onion",
      "source": "KROGER",
      "externalId": "0001111091682",
      "label": "Kroger Yellow Onion 3 lb Bag",
      "active": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Matches on ingredient + source + product id, so re-posting updates labels and `active` instead of duplicating. Response: `{ "created": 3, "updated": 3, "unchanged": 149, "failed": [] }`.

### Review and re-processing

```

## Improving the catalog over time

1. Scrape more recipes.
2. Find what didn't match, most common first:
   ```sql
   select ri.parsed_name, count(*) as times, max(ri.match_score) as best_score, min(ri.raw_text) as example
   from recipe_ingredients ri
   where ri.needs_review
   group by ri.parsed_name
   order by times desc;
   ```
3. Fix the cause: a parser pattern (backend), a new alias or row in `ingredients_seed.csv`, or a manual match in the review queue.
4. Re-run `find_fdc.py` and `seed_ingredients.py` for catalog changes, then `POST /api/admin/recipes/reprocess`.

Planned for the next catalog pass: cooked rice, pasta and grains ("cooked white rice" currently matches raw rice, inflating calories); white wine, pecorino, capers, olives, pine nuts, molasses and canned green chiles; aliases for pasta shapes (paccheri, pappardelle, pastina). "cooking oil" was resolved through the review queue and is already an alias of vegetable oil. Find cooked lines with `select ri.raw_text, i.name from recipe_ingredients ri join ingredients i on i.id = ri.ingredient_id where ri.raw_text ilike '%cooked%';`.
