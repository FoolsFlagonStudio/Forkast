"""Fill in FoodData Central ids for ingredients_seed.csv.

Every row with a blank fdc_id is searched in FDC (SR Legacy first, Foundation as a
fallback). The top hit goes into fdc_id and fdc_description, and the top 5 hits for
each row are written to cache/fdc_candidates.csv so you can swap in a better match.

Rows that already have an fdc_id are skipped, so you can add new rows (or clear a
bad fdc_id and tweak its query) and rerun at any time.

Usage (from data_pipeline/, venv active):
    python find_fdc.py
