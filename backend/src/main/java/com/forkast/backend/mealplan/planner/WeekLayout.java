/**
 * Splits a week into runs: for each slot, the user's count of distinct recipes
 * spread over the
 * 7 days, each cooked once and eaten on the following days.
 *
 * - Runs are as even as possible, longest first: 3 dinners become 3, 2 and 2
 * days.
 * - A run is at most maxRunDays (3), so food is eaten by the second day after
 * cooking.
 * - When the count can't cover the days that way (1 or 2 a week), runs stretch
 * to
 * stretchRunDays (4): 2 dinners become 4 and 3. Days still uncovered (a count
 * of 1 leaves 3)
 * are reported as open.
 * - With leftovers for lunch (and both slots on), each dinner also covers the
 * lunch the day
 * after it's cooked. Lunch runs then fill only the lunch days left, and can't
 * extend past
 * their own freshness window, so a lunch run may be shorter than planned.
 *
 * A plain class: no database, no Spring, so every case is a unit test.
