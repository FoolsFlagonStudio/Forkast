# Victual Mobile

The Victual app for iOS and Android, built with Expo and React Native. This is the user-facing product: preferences, weekly meal plans, recipes, and grocery lists.

> **Status:** every designed screen is built: splash, auth, onboarding, and the main app (Home, Plan, Groceries, Recipes, Profile, recipe detail, cook mode, budget, settings). Auth, preferences, recipes and favorites use the live backend. Meal plans and grocery lists are simulated on the device until the backend's generator exists (see [docs/meal-plan-api.md](docs/meal-plan-api.md)).

## Screens

| Tab / screen | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Home | This week's grocery total vs budget (tap for Budget), today's meals, Regen / Swap / Favs. Empty week and over-budget states. |
| Plan | This week by day, or History week by week |
| Groceries | This week's list by aisle; check items off |
| Recipes | Search, diet filters, collections (under $3, new, quick, meal prep, protein), favorites, infinite scroll |
| Profile | Plan settings (edited with the onboarding screens), appearance, account, support, log out, delete account |
| Recipe detail | Macros, servings scaling, ingredients checklist, directions, nutrition, source link |
| Cook mode | One step at a time, timers parsed from the step ("15-20 minutes" -> 15:00), screen stays on, thumbs up/down at the end |
| Budget | Breakdown by meal, history chart, weeks under budget |

**Lock / swap / regenerate.** The lock on a meal card keeps it through Regen. Swap and Favs open a sheet: pick a meal, then a suggestion (with the price difference) or a favorite. Changing a meal changes every leftover day of it too.

**Data modes** (`src/config/features.ts`, set in `.env.local`):

- Default: live backend, with meal plans simulated on the device (`EXPO_PUBLIC_MOCK_PLANS`, on by default). A dashed "Preview" note shows on plan screens while this is on.
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEMO=1`: everything runs on built-in sample recipes with nine weeks of history, no backend needed. Any email and password logs in. Good for portfolio demos and UI work.

## Responsibilities

The app talks only to the backend API (see [../backend/README.md](../backend/README.md)). It never connects to the database or any third-party data source directly. All recipe parsing, nutrition, pricing, and meal plan generation happen on the backend.

## Auth

Screens live in `src/app/(auth)/`, the session in `src/auth/AuthProvider.tsx`, and the API calls in `src/api/auth.ts`.

```
Splash ──▶ Log In ──▶ Home
   │         │  └─ unverified? ──▶ Verify Email (fresh code sent)
   │         └─ Forgot Password ──▶ Reset Password ──▶ Home
   └──▶ Sign Up ──▶ Verify Email ──▶ Onboarding ──▶ Home
                       └─ Change Email ──▶ back to Sign Up, prefilled
```

- **Codes, not links.** The backend emails a 6-digit code for verification and password resets, so Verify Email has a code entry (it submits on its own, and supports paste and one-time-code autofill) and Reset Password has a code field.
- **Tokens.** The refresh token is stored with `expo-secure-store` (Keychain / Keystore); the short-lived access token stays in memory. On launch the splash restores the session with a refresh. `authedRequest()` attaches the access token and retries once after a refresh on a 401. Refresh tokens rotate, so concurrent refreshes share one call.
- **Route guards.** `(auth)` redirects to Home when signed in; `(app)` redirects to Log In when signed out.
- **Social sign-in** (Google/Apple) is built but switched off in `src/config/features.ts` until the backend supports it.
- **Change Email** goes back to Sign Up with the details filled in, because the backend has no way for an unverified account to change its address yet.

## Onboarding

New accounts (no saved preferences, `user.onboardingCompleted` false) are routed to `/onboarding` from anywhere in the app. It's one screen with ten steps so answers survive going back and forth: `src/onboarding/OnboardingFlow.tsx` runs it, `steps.tsx` has one component per step, and `model.ts` holds the answers, the option lists and the mapping to `PreferencesRequest`.

1. Intro
2. Weekly budget (presets or type your own; Next disabled at $0)
3. Household size (1-20)
4. Meals to cover (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
5. Recipes per week for each meal (1-7; every meal covers all 7 days, so fewer recipes means leftovers)
6. Week start day and auto-planning - not in the Figma; the backend needs `planStartDay`
7. Diets
8. Allergies
9. Macro targets (optional, per meal)
10. Review (tap a row to jump back and edit), then "Building your plan" with the steaming bowl animation

How answers map to the backend:

- Diets and allergies become dietary label ids (`vegan`, `high-protein`, `nut-free`, `dairy-free`...). Low Calorie and Low Carb aren't labels, so they pre-fill the per-meal calorie (500) and carb (30 g) targets instead, which recipe ranking uses.
- Macros are per meal, matching `RecipeFitEvaluator`. Fiber from the Figma is left out because the backend doesn't store it.
- `repeatAvoidanceDays` is sent as the backend default (14).
- Location isn't asked: pricing will be averaged instead of per store.
- **Resume:** progress (current step + answers) is saved on the device with AsyncStorage as you go, one draft per account, and restored if the app is closed mid-way. The draft is cleared once preferences are saved. Unreadable, out-of-range or older-format drafts fall back to step 1 (bump `VERSION` in `src/onboarding/draft.ts` when the answers shape changes).
- "Building your plan" saves preferences (falling back to PUT if they already exist), generates the first week, and holds for ~2.6 s.
- The week start step also sets **auto-planning**: on by default, building next week's plan the day before the week starts. Changing the start day moves the auto-plan day with it until the user picks one themselves. Both are editable later under Profile > Week and auto-planning.

### Pointing the app at the backend

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`. On a real phone, `localhost` means the phone, so use your computer's LAN IP (Windows: `ipconfig`, "IPv4 Address") with the backend running, e.g. `http://192.168.1.42:8080`. Restart `npx expo start` after changing it.

## Cost Notes

`costPerServing` is an estimate in USD from one representative store, refreshed weekly. When `costComplete` is false, some lines couldn't be priced and the real cost is higher; show it as "from $X" or with an "estimate" label rather than as an exact price. `estimatedCost` in recipe detail is what the chosen servings use, not what a shopping trip costs (the grocery list buys whole packages).

## Meal Plan Notes

- A plan is a list of `selections` (one recipe cooked once, eaten over `daysCovered` days) plus a `days` calendar. Lock and swap act on a selection, so a swap changes every day that recipe covers. A meal marked `leftover` is eaten from an earlier cook.
- A selection whose cook day is today or earlier can't be swapped (409); grey out its swap button.
- Compare `groceryCost` (what the trip costs) with `budget`; `overBudget` is set from it. `usageCost` is what the meals use.
- Grocery amounts are exact; show `displayAmount`. A line with `estimate: true` has no package to price it by. Pantry lines count at what the week uses; offer "need to buy" to switch one to its full package price.
- Grocery line ids survive swaps and regenerates, and so do the purchased checkmarks.

| Area         | Technology                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Framework    | React Native via Expo (SDK 58)                         |
| Navigation   | Expo Router (file-based, routes in `src/app/`)         |
| Language     | TypeScript                                             |
| Styling      | React Native styles + a theme from the shared tokens   |
| Icons        | Lucide (`lucide-react-native`)                         |
| Fonts        | Poppins (UI), DM Sans (brand) via `@expo-google-fonts` |
| Distribution | App Store and Google Play, built with EAS              |

## Setup

Requires Node 20.19+ (22 recommended).

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npx expo start         # scan the QR code with Expo Go (iPhone camera / Android Expo Go app)
npm run typecheck
```

Set the backend URL first (see "Pointing the app at the backend" above). Your phone and computer need to be on the same Wi-Fi. If they can't see each other, use `npx expo start --tunnel`.

Use `npx expo install <package>` instead of `npm install` for anything with native code, so you get the version that matches the Expo SDK.

**iOS builds without a Mac:** Expo Go covers day-to-day testing on a real iPhone. For App Store builds (and any native module Expo Go doesn't include), use EAS to build in the cloud: `npx eas-cli@latest build --platform ios`.

## How Styling Works

- **Design tokens** live in `../design/tokens.json`. `src/theme/tokens.ts` and `src/theme/icons.ts` are generated from it, so don't edit them by hand. After changing the JSON, run `node design/build-tokens.mjs` from the repo root.
- **`useTheme()`** (`src/theme/themeContext.ts`) returns `colors` for the current mode plus `spacing`, `radius` and `palette`, and `setPreference('light' | 'dark' | 'system')`.
- **`<Text variant="h1">`** (`src/components/Text.tsx`) applies the Figma type styles with the right font file and theme color. Use it instead of React Native's `Text`.
- **Fonts**: React Native needs one font per weight. `src/theme/fonts.ts` loads them and maps `(family, weight)` to the loaded name. To use a new weight, add it there.
- **Splash**: the app holds the native splash until fonts load, so nothing flashes in a fallback font. The native splash image is built to the same measurements as the Splash screen, so the hand-off doesn't jump.
- **Sizes**: designs are 402x874 Figma frames (iPhone points), so Figma px values are used as-is.

```tsx
const { colors, spacing } = useTheme();
<View style={{ backgroundColor: colors.background, padding: spacing.lg }}>
  <Logo height={40} />
  <Text variant="h2">This week</Text>
  <Icon.groceries size={24} color={colors.primary} />
</View>
```

## App Icon and Splash

Generated from the logo in `../design/brand/` and stored in `assets/images/`: `icon.png` (iOS and store), the Android adaptive icon layers (forest background, mark foreground, monochrome for themed icons), `splash-icon.png` (the stacked mark + wordmark from the Splash frame, from `design/brand/splash-stacked.svg`), and `favicon.png`.
